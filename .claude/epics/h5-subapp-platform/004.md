# Task 004: Shared Component Library Foundation

## Overview

Extend Arco Design Mobile with custom components to create a comprehensive shared component library for the H5 sub-app platform. This library will provide 10-15 essential mobile-optimized components with a unified theming system.

## Technical Requirements

### Component Development
- Extend Arco Design Mobile base components
- Create 10-15 essential mobile components (Button, Form inputs, Navigation, Cards, Lists, etc.)
- Implement TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Add accessibility support (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Ensure responsive design for various mobile screen sizes

### Theming System
- Create centralized theme configuration system
- Support light/dark mode theming
- Implement CSS-in-JS or CSS variables approach
- Enable runtime theme switching
- Provide theme customization API

### Build and Distribution
- Configure build pipeline for component library
- Set up tree-shaking support for optimal bundle sizes
- Create separate entry points for individual components
- Generate TypeScript declaration files
- Package for NPM distribution

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- [001] Monorepo Setup and Configuration

**External Dependencies:**
- React 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Arco Design Mobile
- Build tools (Vite/Rollup)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Components (Must Have)
- [ ] Button component with variants (primary, secondary, ghost, danger)
- [ ] Input components (text, password, search, numeric)
- [ ] Form components (Form, FormItem, validation integration)
- [ ] Navigation components (TabBar, NavBar, Breadcrumb)
- [ ] Layout components (Grid, Space, Divider)
- [ ] Feedback components (Toast, Modal, ActionSheet)
- [ ] Display components (Card, List, Avatar, Badge)

### Theming Implementation
- [ ] Theme provider component with context
- [ ] CSS custom properties for theme variables
- [ ] Light and dark theme presets
- [ ] Runtime theme switching functionality
- [ ] Theme validation and type safety

### Quality Standards
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for all components
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compatibility
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- [ ] Storybook documentation for each component
- [ ] Performance: < 50KB compressed bundle size per component

### Build System
- [ ] Component library builds successfully
- [ ] Tree-shaking works correctly (unused components excluded)
- [ ] TypeScript declarations generated automatically
- [ ] ESM and CJS outputs available
- [ ] Sourcemaps included for debugging

## Technical Approach

### Architecture
```
packages/ui-components/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Button/
│   │   ├── Input/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── themes/
│   │   ├── default.ts
│   │   ├── dark.ts
│   │   └── types.ts
│   ├── utils/
│   └── index.ts
├── stories/
├── tests/
└── package.json
```

### Component Structure
- Consistent API patterns across all components
- Composition over inheritance for component variants
- Prop forwarding for underlying Arco Design components
- Custom styling while maintaining Arco Design functionality

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with React Testing Library
- Visual regression tests with Storybook
- Accessibility tests with jest-axe
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Risk Mitigation

**Arco Design Mobile Compatibility**
- Regular testing against Arco Design Mobile updates
- Version pinning for stable releases
- Custom component wrappers to isolate breaking changes

**Performance Concerns**
- Bundle size monitoring and budgets
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Tree-shaking verification for all components

**Theming Complexity**
- Start with simple CSS custom properties
- Progressive enhancement for advanced theming features
- Fallback support for older browsers

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 10-15 components implemented and tested
- [ ] Theming system fully functional with light/dark modes
- [ ] Component library packages and publishes successfully
- [ ] Storybook documentation complete
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Integration tested with sample sub-app

## Estimated Effort Breakdown

- Component implementation: 20 hours
- Theming system: 6 hours
- Testing and documentation: 4 hours
- Build system setup: 2 hours

**Total: 32 hours**
