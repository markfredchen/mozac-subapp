# Task 001: Monorepo Setup and Workspace Configuration

## Description

Configure the foundational monorepo structure using pnpm workspaces, establish TypeScript project configuration across packages, and set up consistent ESLint and Prettier standards for code quality and formatting. This creates the base infrastructure for all subsequent development work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] pnpm workspace configuration file created with proper package organization
- [ ] Root package.json configured with workspace dependencies and scripts
- [ ] TypeScript configuration established with shared base config and package-specific overrides
- [ ] ESLint configuration with React, TypeScript, and mobile-specific rules
- [ ] Prettier configuration with consistent formatting standards
- [ ] Directory structure created: packages/, apps/, tools/, docs/
- [ ] Basic CI/CD workflow file for workspace validation
- [ ] All configurations validate and build successfully
- [ ] Documentation for workspace setup and development workflow

## Technical Details

### Workspace Structure
```
/
├── packages/          # Shared libraries and components
├── apps/             # Sub-applications
├── tools/            # CLI tools and build utilities
├── docs/             # Documentation
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── package.json      # Root workspace config
├── tsconfig.json     # Base TypeScript config
├── eslint.config.js  # ESLint configuration
└── prettier.config.js
```

### Key Configuration Requirements
- pnpm workspace with proper dependency hoisting
- TypeScript strict mode with mobile-specific compiler options
- ESLint rules for React 18, TypeScript, and accessibility
- Prettier with mobile-friendly line lengths and formatting
- Workspace scripts for common operations (build, test, lint)

### Dependencies
- pnpm >= 8.0.0
- TypeScript >= 5.0.0
- ESLint >= 8.0.0 with React and TypeScript plugins
- Prettier >= 3.0.0

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: None - This is a foundation task

**Enables**: All subsequent tasks require this workspace structure

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: M (Medium)
**Hours**: 16
**Complexity**: Medium - Standard monorepo setup with mobile-specific configurations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Workspace builds without errors using `pnpm build`
- [ ] Linting passes with `pnpm lint`
- [ ] Formatting is consistent with `pnpm format`
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds across all packages
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline validates workspace integrity
- [ ] Developer onboarding documentation is complete and tested
- [ ] All package.json files follow consistent naming and versioning
- [ ] Workspace dependency graph is optimized for build performance
