}
```

### Performance Metrics
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  loading: {
    fcp: number;
    lcp: number;
    tti: number;
    fid: number;
  };
  runtime: {
    memory: number;
    cpu: number;
    fps: number;
  };
  network: {
    requests: number;
    transferred: number;
    cached: number;
  };
}
```

### Budget Configuration
```json
{
  "budgets": {
    "initialBundle": {
      "maxSize": "1.5MB",
      "gzipped": "500KB"
    },
    "totalBundle": {
      "maxSize": "3MB",
      "gzipped": "1MB"
    },
    "performance": {
      "fcp": "2s",
