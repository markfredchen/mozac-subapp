# PRD: H5 Sub-Application Platform

## Executive Summary

The H5 Sub-Application Platform is a comprehensive development and deployment system that enables teams to build, package, and deploy mobile web applications as independent sub-applications. Built on React, TypeScript, pnpm monorepo, and Arco Design Mobile framework, this platform addresses the growing need for scalable mobile web development while maintaining consistency and performance across multiple applications.

The platform solves critical pain points in mobile H5 development including bundle size management, dependency conflicts, development isolation, and seamless integration with native mobile applications through a zip-based deployment model.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Modern mobile development teams face significant challenges when building H5 applications:

1. **Scalability Issues**: As teams grow, managing multiple H5 applications becomes complex with shared dependencies, conflicting versions, and coordination overhead
2. **Performance Constraints**: Mobile web applications struggle with bundle size, load times, and performance on low-end devices and slow networks
3. **Development Inefficiency**: Teams duplicate components, utilities, and configurations across projects, leading to inconsistency and maintenance overhead
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Integrating H5 applications into native mobile apps lacks standardization and proper versioning
5. **Quality Control**: Ensuring consistent code quality, performance standards, and mobile optimization across multiple applications

### Why is this important now?

- Mobile web traffic continues to grow, requiring faster, more efficient development processes
- Teams are scaling rapidly and need isolated development workflows
- Native app teams demand better integration patterns for H5 content
- Performance expectations for mobile web applications are increasing
- The need for code reuse and consistency across multiple applications is critical

## User Stories
